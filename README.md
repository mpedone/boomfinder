A minesweeper-like game

## What's all this then?
I'm sure most of us are familiar with the classic Windows game "Minesweeper". If you hated that game, maybe just skip this. I, for one, enjoyed the game, and have decided to challenge myself to recreate it in Python. I think it will be a fun challenge, and I think the fact that it's a mechanic I am familiar with will make it easier to figure out the logic, as opposed to something completely new.
